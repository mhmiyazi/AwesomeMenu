 Change the Sidebar icon and username:
--------------------------------------

* Find out class="profile" in /index.html
* Then change <img src="dist/img/avatar.png" alt=""><p>BlackX-732</p>



 How to classify different background source before collapse and after collapse:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to change background source of .main-container after collapse then ad below's code into .collapse .main-container

    background: url(new-image.jpg) no-repeat center center;
    background-size: cover;
    height: 100vh;

* no-repeat -> for miss-match size of image
* center -> vertically center
* center -> horizontally center
* 100vh -> 100% vertical & 100% horizontal

 For little more smoothness add this to previous class

    transition: 0.3s;


That's all.Enjoy Our code by your own way.(^_^)
